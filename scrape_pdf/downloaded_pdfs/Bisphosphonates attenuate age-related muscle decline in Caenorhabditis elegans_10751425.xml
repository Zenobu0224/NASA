Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3449</offset><text>Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia. However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub‐optimal, and certain older individuals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to exercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physically inactive, meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side‐effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long‐term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease but is a potent immunosuppressant unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4643</offset><text>Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle. Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation, while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions. Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health, with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together. Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular first‐line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display significant increases in muscle strength and total muscle mass. Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. Retrospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit significant increases in total lean muscle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated controls. In the ageing context, ZA‐treated fruit flies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular ageing. However, the direct anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of ZA has not been established.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6302</offset><text>The nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans  is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age‐related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle.  C. elegans  muscle is also highly morphologically and metabolically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60–85%) of sub‐muscular systems with people. As with fruit flies,  C. elegans  are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (‘osteokines’).  C. elegans  are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle‐specific mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone‐derived confounders. We thus employed  C. elegans  as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone‐independent effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near‐term applicability in the clinic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7245</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7253</offset><text>Assessing zoledronic acid effects on  Caenorhabditis elegans  lifespan and healthspan</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7339</offset><text>Wild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50  Escherichia coli  bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 μL of dilute compound (i.e. – 100 μL of 2.3 μM, 23 μM, 230 μM, 2.3 mM and 11.5 μM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 500 μM concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume to achieve the desired final concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100 μL of ddH2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns.

From these pooled samples, ~70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the Infinity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for 90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a further 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with ~200 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH2O.

Using the Infinity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), computational coefficients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coefficients were &lt;0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were &gt;0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was employed as one of the most robust measures of animal healthspan. For quantification, animals that obtained coefficients of 0.01–0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inactive. Animals with scores of 0.41–1 were classed as ‘active’ animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body‐length in displacement between subsequent frames).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10411</offset><text>Both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidic‐housed populations.

Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the mid‐animal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egg‐laying induced tissue disruption) using an Orca‐spark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of 3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual muscle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarcomere or mitochondria structures as previously described (see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of structural defect).

Complementary drug interventions would, therefore, benefit a significant portion of the ageing population, yet effectual compounds that are safe for long‐term use remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immediately exploitable pharmaceuticals for the general population. Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis for decades. Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) extend  C. elegans  lifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial decline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we establish muscle‐centric myokines (agxt‐2 and igdb‐1) and mitochondrial sirtuin (sir‐2.3) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27786</offset><text>Growing pre‐clinical and human evidence suggest that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of conditions. A recent study in fruit flies suggest similar effects might extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treatment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan. We provide the first in vivo evidence for a direct role of chronic bisphosphonate administration in delaying age‐related muscle structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alterations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to lowered motility in animals, bisphosphonate‐mediated sarcomere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia in higher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial structure corresponds with oxidative function; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efficacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarcomeric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond, the point of onset of age‐related sub‐muscular decline, the anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of bisphosphonates into very old age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our microfluidic healthspan device and animal movement rate as a robust index of health, we demonstrate that early‐ to mid‐life muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thus represent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and whole animal health into older age.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29420</offset><text>In fruit flies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream FOXO activation. We extend this by implicating the mevalonate‐FOXO system as necessary for bisphosphonate‐mediated health improvements across the life course. The sterol and non‐sterol isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and influence several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which associate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (fdps‐1), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of normal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps‐1 RNAi. Thereafter, downregulation of fdps‐1 causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable to improve lifespan and healthspan in fdps‐1 or daf‐16 knockdown animals, the mevalonate‐FOXO pathway is strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health benefits of bisphosphonates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30722</offset><text>Bi‐directional communication between muscle and bone has long been established, including mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone signalling. We, therefore, examined the mechanistic role of three putative muscle‐derived signalling factors (‘myokines’) involved in muscle‐bone crosstalk that exhibit altered age‐related function. Of these, agxt‐2/BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan effects of ZA, while agxt‐2 KD alone was not harmful to animal longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, anti‐inflammation and osteocyte survival in mice, and its expression does not decline with age; thus, BAIBA‐mediated muscle/health benefits of bisphosphonates would be anticipated to remain in older age. Knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopenia biomarker. The healthspan effects of igdb‐1 KD were also comparable with ZA co‐treatment. This inability of idgb‐1 KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive effects of ZA could be interpreted as ZA exerting healthspan‐promoting inhibitory effects on igdb‐1 or, alternatively, acting through igdb‐1 independent pathways. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced lifespan and healthspan extension. Because  C. elegans  lack an endoskeleton, these findings espouse agxt‐2/BAIBA and igdb‐1/FNDC5 as muscle‐intrinsic, bone‐independent mechanisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32266</offset><text>Recent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenuate denervation atrophy by down‐regulating sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrially localized NAD+‐dependent deacetylase with important roles in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism.

Because sir‐2.3 KD with combined ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically beneficial to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model of bisphosphonate‐mediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as a regulator of mammalian muscle health and now sarcopenia. Loss of sir‐2.2 was, however, dispensable for the positive effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrial mechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33243</offset><text>In conclusion, chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in a  C. elegans  model of sarcopenia, and this translates to improved animal health across the entire life course.

Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms of bisphosphonates can also be muscle‐intrinsic. By directly implicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploitable
