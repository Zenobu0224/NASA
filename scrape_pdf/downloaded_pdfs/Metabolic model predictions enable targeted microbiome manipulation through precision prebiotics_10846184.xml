Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1366</offset><text>IMPORTANCE</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1377</offset><text>While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11.

These microbial communities fulfill essential roles in pathogen protection, immune system education, production of vitamins, metabolism of xenobiotics, and increase the plasticity of their host to respond to evolutionary challenges. Thus, the composition of the microbiota plays an important role in the well-being of hosts and its ability to respond to environmental challenges, as indicated by the frequent shift of microbiota composition observed in the context of diseases and exposure to environmental stressors. These observations and work in animal models have led to the development of the notion that the composition of the microbiome itself might be an important modulator of host health as well as fitness and that a targeted modulation of microbiome composition might offer a completely new avenue for modulating the host.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3502</offset><text>It has been shown that dietary patterns (e.g., western diet) can affect the structure of the microbiome, however their effect is transient. Besides an influence of dietary uptake on microbiome composition, various approaches to modify the microbial communities of organisms have been used: the transfer of entire microbial communities from a donor to a recipient host (fecal transfer), the provision of compounds used by particular microbial species (prebiotics), the provision of microbial strains of natural or synthetic origin (probiotics), the provision of compounds of microbial origin (postbiotics), and combinations thereof (synbiotics). While fecal transfer is the most commonly used approach to modulate microbial community composition in animal models, it involves the transfer of entire microbial communities and therefore not only desirable traits. In consequence, there is only a single medical indication in which fecal transfers are routinely used thus far and there are potential concerns about the safety and stability of the engraftment of transplants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4573</offset><text>Although the concept of supplementation with pre-, pro-, or synbiotics has been commonly proposed as a method of microbial manipulation, these approaches are still severely limited. In humans, oligosaccharides are proposed as prebiotics to alter the microbial community on both the structural and functional level, since they can be fermented by microbial species, which in turn can proliferate and produce bioactive compounds such as short-chain fatty acids. However, there is only little knowledge about other classes of compounds that might alter the microbial composition. Another important aspect to consider is the specificity with which individual target microorganisms can be manipulated using prebiotics. Thus, while oligosaccharides are considered beneficial, there is often uncertainty about which species can degrade them, as multiple, unrelated species can degrade similar types of oligosaccharides (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacterium species can degrade fructans). In case of supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics, other concerns have been raised. For instance, the ability of specific Bifidobacteria to stably colonize the human gut was only reported for ⅓ of the participants in a clinical trial. Moreover, introducing exogenous bacteria can have unwanted side effects. For example, some of the Bacillus species that were used as probiotics in aquacultures were found to carry virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes. Hence, to overcome these limitations in current microbiome manipulation approaches, we need to focus on prebiotics with well-controlled modes of action (e.g., based on known microbial pathways that can degrade prebiotics) that preferentially modulate the abundance of resident microbial species. Since mechanisms of pathogenicity are often complex and context-specific, it is preferred if these species are native to the microbiome of the host, as unwanted side-effects due to the introduction of foreign bacterial species might be avoided. Within this work, we will refer to prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of selected bacterial strains within the microbiome of a specific host as “precision prebiotics.”</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6770</offset><text>To design and evaluate such precision prebiotics, it is essential to start with a tractable model system such as the well-established model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The native microbial community of the invertebrate C. elegans was first described in 2016, yet the nematode has already been used for over 20 years as a model for studying host-microbial interactions. To similarly promote C. elegans-microbiome research, a synthetic 12-member C. elegans-specific microbiome resource, CeMbio, was recently established. Part of this consortium is the Gram-negative Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 that is known to possess antifungal and antimicrobial properties, thereby providing protection against the pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Besides its protective effects, MYb11 is known to colonize and persist in the C. elegans intestine and thus increase the nematode’s fitness during infection. Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 is another member of the CeMbio community and affects different host life-history traits, persistently colonizes the nematode, and has been described as competitive against other bacteria in terms of space and nutrients. Furthermore, the bacterial strain MYb11 was only able to grow on sucrose when co-cultured with MYb71 but not when cultured alone, suggesting that the two bacterial strains interact metabolically. Hence, a microbial community consisting of one beneficial bacterium and another one that is competitive offers an excellent opportunity for developing targeted approaches for microbiome manipulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8312</offset><text>A key prerequisite for the development of precision prebiotics is a detailed understanding of the metabolic functions present within a microbial community and how specific metabolic interventions affect microbiome metabolism. One important approach to investigate metabolic functions in microbial communities is constraint-based metabolic modeling. Based on the genetic information either on the level of each bacterium or from the overall community and biochemical databases, these methods allow one to simulate the network of chemical reactions that represent the metabolic reactions of the microorganism(s) or the community. To this end, genome-scale metabolic models of the bacterial species within a microbiome have to be reconstructed from genomic data. These models summarize the metabolic functions present within an organism and can be reconstructed using automated reconstruction approaches or obtained from existing model repositories. Furthermore, accounting for the growth environment of a species, optimization approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA) for individual species or constraint-based community modeling approaches can be used to predict metabolic activities within individual species as well as interactions between species. These methods have already been used to identify metabolic alterations in the microbiome of Parkinson’s disease patients as well as patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to study the interaction of C. elegans as well as its microbiota in the context of drug-microbiome-host interactions. For C. elegans, metabolic models of the CeMbio community including MYb11 and MYb71 and other members of the microbiota are available.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9999</offset><text>In this work, we used metabolic networks of MYb11 and MYb71 also incorporating phenotypic information from Biolog growth assays in a computational screen for precision prebiotics that are able to specifically boost the abundance of the host-protective strain MYb11 over MYb71. We tested four of the predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro and confirmed that they selectively boost the abundance of MYb11. Moving to the C. elegans host system, we moreover showed that L-serine is able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 when the C. elegans host was colonized with both bacterial species. Thus, we demonstrate that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches could represent a key tool for the design of targeted microbiome intervention approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>10828</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10850</offset><text>Computational methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>10872</offset><text>Identification of unique uptake compounds</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10914</offset><text>We explored to what extent individual metabolites, which are only taken up by a single bacterial species and no other, could serve as potential supplements to target individual species. To this end, we considered gut microbiome data from a Kiel-based human cohort comprising 1,280 participants for which 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is available, which we had utilized previously. As reported previously, the reads were mapped to the 16S sequences of the genomes of bacterial species present in the AGORA bacterial collection, the read counts of each sample were normalized to a sum of 1 and removal of species below 0.1% abundance in each sample. We used gapseq version 1.1 on the genomes of the identified species assuming the averaged dietary uptake of the human cohort as input to the models to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models. Subsequently, we identified for each bacterial species which metabolites can be taken up. To this end, for each exchange reaction of a metabolite, we set the respective reaction as an objective reaction. By convention, bacterial uptake of metabolites is modeled by exchange reactions where the forward direction corresponds to an excretion of a compound and the backward direction (i.e., negative flux) to its uptake. Therefore, we minimized the flux through each exchange reaction using FBA implemented in the R-package sybil which corresponds to maximizing the uptake of that metabolite. If the minimal flux through the exchange reaction was non-zero this metabolite could be taken up. Having repeated this procedure for each exchange reaction, we identified those compounds that can be taken up for each species. Then, we determined for each individual bacterial species in the gut microbiome of each participant whether it could take up a compound that could not be taken up by any other species in the bacterial community of this participant. Finally, we determined for each participant which fraction of the bacterial species contained in the gut microbiome had at least one unique uptake compound. Similarly, we reconstructed 78 bacterial models belonging to the C. elegans microbiota based on their published genomes using gapseq version 1.2. We then created random subsets of the models with increasing sizes (from 2 to 78, 50 iterations for each size) and determined the portion of strains with unique uptake compounds for each community. For the CeMbio community we used metabolic models reconstructed with gapseq 1.2 from Zimmermann et al.. In general, the software gapseq has an extensive published documentation regarding the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models, also available online (https://gapseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>13612</offset><text>Computational supplementation experiments</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13654</offset><text>In our simulations, we utilized metabolic networks of P. lurida MYb11 and O. vermis MYb71 that were created from their genome sequences using gapseq version 1.1. Information from phenotypic microarrays about the organisms' metabolic capacities was integrated into the models using the “adapt” module of gapseq. Specifically, we incorporated data from the Biolog EcoPlate (assuming growth if OD590–OD750 &gt;0.1). During growth simulations, exchange fluxes of the models were constrained by assuming a computational nematode growth medium (NGM) and aerobic conditions. These constraints can be found in Table S1. Additionally, the inflow of copper and iron cations was increased, so that they did not restrict the growth of the models. Following published practices and due to the lack of the required kinetic information, we used the concentration values of the NGM medium input for the lower bounds of the models.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14572</offset><text>We used three distinct approaches for modeling individual microbes and microbial communities. To model the growth of each bacterium independently, we used FBA. We also utilized individual-based modeling based on BacArena R-package and a community-FBA as described previously. The community-FBA approach is implemented in the R-package MicrobiomeGS2 (www.github.com/Waschina/MicrobiomeGS2) and an overview has been described in detail in the publication by Pryor et al.. To measure the effects of supplements on growth of the individual species, we modified the published approach, so that we did not fix species composition but let it be determined as part of the optimization of individual species biomasses. In all types of simulations, we focused on the identification of nutritional supplements that boosted the growth of the target species MYb11.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15424</offset><text>For the individual supplementation experiments, the metabolic models of both organisms were constrained with the NGM computational diet, assuming that the molecular values of the dietary compounds (molecular quantities) can be directly incorporated into the models (as fluxes in the lower bounds of the models) without any transformation. This is based on the assumption that the uptake rate of compounds is depicted by its maximum available amount. Supplementations for each metabolite were conducted by increasing the possible influx of the supplemented metabolite by 10 mmol/L. For testing the effects of supplements on single growth, the relative increase in growth rate compared to growth without supplements for each model was recorded. To prevent any numerical instabilities, all raw values were rounded to the sixth digit and relative changes bigger than 0.01 were taken into account.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16317</offset><text>For simulations using community FBA, the metabolic models of both organisms were merged into one microbial community, compartmentalized, model. Please note that we did not use a fixed community biomass composition as previously, since we employed community FBA to predict the resulting growth rates of individual species after maximizing the growth of the community. Thus, the community model was constrained with the NGM diet—extended with the individual supplements, as described in the previous paragraph. The growth rates of individual species were predicted by maximizing the sum of the growth rates of individual species with concomitant minimization of the sum of total fluxes as implemented in the R-package sybil (with a coefficient of −10−6 for the sum of fluxes in the objective function). Since the supplementations usually also increased the growth of the entire community, the predicted growth rates of each species were normalized with the respective growth rate of the community. Predicted growth rates following supplementation were contrasted against growth rates without supplementation to identify compounds whose effect was larger for the growth of MYb11 in comparison to MYb71. To exclude any numerical artifacts, rounding to the sixth digit and a cutoff of 0.01 in compound selection were also applied in this section.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17665</offset><text>For individual-based modeling of microbial communities, the metabolic models of both species were simulated in a virtual environment in BacArena, where they could randomly move and reproduce on a 30 × 30 grid. As a growth medium, we used the NGM diet (in mM) which we diluted 1,000-fold, because otherwise bacterial models overgrew the entire simulation environment before nutrients were exhausted. For the simulations, we inoculated the growth environment with 20 individuals of each species and simulated bacterial growth for 12 iterations with 15 replicates for each supplementation using FBA. Replicates are needed since, in contrast to FBA, BacArena includes a stochastic component such as a random initial placement of individuals, random movement of individuals and random cellular replication events. A secondary objective to minimize the total flux while maximizing the growth rates of individuals was applied. To simulate the supplementation experiments, 0.01 mM of each compound of interest was added once in the beginning of the simulation. To identify significant changes in the growth profiles of individual species following each supplementation, we extracted the cell biomass information from the simulations using the command plotGrowthCurve and we calculated the relative change of the total biomass values (time step 13; rounding to the sixth digit) due the supplementations for each model. Then, the relative changes between the bacterial models were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The resulting P values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate control implemented in R. We selected those compounds whose effect on MYb11 was larger than on MYb71 based on the median of the respective relative changes for each model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19435</offset><text>Based on these simulation techniques, we identified those compounds that specifically boosted MYb11 across the simulations.

For the enrichment analysis of growth-supporting compounds of MYb11, we used the human metabolome database (HMDB) annotation for the available metabolite classes. Briefly, we tested whether the sets of candidate compounds were enriched in the metabolite classes defined in HMDB using Fisher’s exact test. As the underlying set of metabolites, we used the metabolites contained in the metabolic model of MYb11 in the different metabolite classes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>20146</offset><text>System information and software</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20178</offset><text>Simulations and analyses were performed in the R environment (versions 4.0.0, 4.0.3, and 4.2.1).

Hence, these compounds correspond to unique metabolic niches for the respective bacterial species. We initially tested computationally whether such unique uptake compounds typically exist in bacterial communities, using bacterial communities from a human cohort as well as C. elegans. We evaluated for each bacterial species of a particular community whether it was able to take up a metabolite that no other species of the community could take up and determined the fraction of bacterial species in the community that had such unique uptake compounds (see Materials and Methods). For the human cohort, the bacterial communities comprised on average 26–34 bacterial species (25–75% quantiles). Within this community size, on average, 5–20% of bacterial species were inferred to possess unique uptake compounds that could potentially be used to target those species. For smaller communities, up to 50% of bacterial species and for larger communities, only 5–10% had unique uptake compounds (Fig. 1A). For C. elegans, we do not have matching data like for the human cohort with species abundance information for a large number of samples and genome sequences of the corresponding bacterial species for metabolic modeling. However, we can use strains that have been isolated from C. elegans and its environment as well as artificial minimal C. elegans communities to approximate the frequency of unique uptake compounds in the C. elegans microbiota. Thus, within a sample of 78 bacterial species isolated from C. elegans and its environment, we usually only identified 3–5% of species with unique uptake compounds in communities comprising 30 or more bacterial species, which is the typical size of bacterial communities observed in C. elegans-derived microbiome samples (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in the artificial CeMbio C. elegans model microbiome community unique uptake compounds could usually only be detected for subsets of bacterial species up to a size of six member species (Fig. 1C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">spectrum.01144-23.f001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>30423</offset><text>Frequency of species with unique uptake compounds in microbiomes.

The first one is based on BacArena that incorporates an individual-based modeling approach and the other one is so-called community FBA implemented in MicrobiomeGS2. These two modeling approaches differ in their underlying assumptions. In BacArena the two bacteria are modeled by their individual metabolic networks and fluxes are predicted by maximizing the biomass fluxes of individual bacteria. In community FBA, in turn, the metabolic networks of the individual bacterial species are merged into a community model for which the sum of biomass fluxes of both bacterial species is maximized. Thus, when using BacArena, metabolic interactions between species typically arise from one species secreting an end-product that another species can metabolize. In community FBA, in turn, the optimization of total growth assumes that bacterial species coordinate their metabolic fluxes so that overall growth is maximized. Thus, since we do not know to which extent MYb11 and MYb71 mutually interact with each other, we cover both ends of the spectrum of potential interactions between species from completely individually optimized behavior in BacArena to an absolute coordination of fluxes to maximize overall community growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34398</offset><text>Using FBA, we identified 29 compounds that could increase the growth of MYb11 in single growth.

In order to determine whether specific compound classes were enriched among the MYb11-supporting compounds, we performed an enrichment based on HMDB annotation across the three different simulation types. We found that growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 were enriched for fatty acids (Fisher’s exact test P value = 3.16 × 10−5).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35009</offset><text>Interestingly, the growth dynamics of the models when they were part of a community model (Fig. 2B) differ from the growth dynamics of the models when they were treated as individual organisms (Fig. 2C). For instance, MYb71’s biomass flux was much higher in the community model, i.e., when coupled to the model MYb11. This is a typical observation when using community FBA when the biomass of the entire community is maximized. Especially for small communities, this often leads to one community member that most efficiently turns the growth medium into biomass to grow strongest with only little growth for other community members. On the other hand, in the BacArena simulations, we observed that most of those compounds boosted the growth of both species in single growth, however, the effect was larger for MYb11 than MYb71 (Fig. 2C). While BacArena also uses FBA to simulate bacterial growth, only a subset of FBA-predicted compounds that increase the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 was actually also identified by the BacArena approach (17 out of 29). The likely reason is that the FBA approach does not take into account potential interactions between species and that BacArena incorporates a stochastic component, for instance, for determining positioning as well as movement of bacteria and cellular replication events, such that small differences in growth rate between bacterial species might be filtered out by these stochastic events. Of the identified compounds, 17 compounds were shared across the three simulations. For eight of these, also information on uptake by MYb11 was available from Biolog plates which confirmed that MYb11 was able to consume them (Fig. 2D). Thus, combining modeling approaches and cross-referencing data from Biolog plates allowed us to considerably reduce our list of candidates to test experimentally to those giving the most consistent results. Based on the available literature information on the role of these compounds in longevity of the host or physiology, as nutritional compounds, or compounds that are involved in host-microbial interactions, we selected four candidates for further experimental testing as precision prebiotics to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>37237</offset><text>In vitro validation of predicted precision prebiotics</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37291</offset><text>As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested the ability of four of the predicted precision prebiotics compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, GABA, and D-mannitol, to specifically increase the growth of MYb11 in co-culture with MYb71.

GABA, apart from being a bacterial product, is protective for the host’s neurons.

Additionally, to quantify bacterial growth, we used fluorescently labeled strains. CFU of mono- and co-culture were plated and counted after 24 h growth in liquid culture in the presence (10 mM) or absence (0 mM) of the four compounds L-serine (Fig. 3B; Table S10), L-threonine (Fig. 3C; Table S12), GABA (Fig. 3D; Table S13), and D-mannitol (Fig. 3E; Table S14).

Synchronized populations of L1 larvae were pipetted onto bacterial lawns of MYb11 and MYb71 on solid NGM plates supplemented with either 0, 10, or 100 mM L-serine. After 72 h, adult worms were collected to quantify bacterial proportions. Supplementation at 10 mM L-serine did not change the proportion of MYb11 in co-culture in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, P = 0.459, Fig. 5A left panel). However, L-serine supplementation at 100 mM increased the proportion of MYb11 in the bacterial community in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 5A, right panel). We next asked whether the effect of supplementation on bacterial proportions in the host simply reflected changes in the proportion of bacteria that were available to them on the lawn (i.e., their diet). The relative abundance of MYb11 on lawns did not change by 10 mM supplementation (GLM, P = 0.61, Fig. 5A, left panel) compared to non-supplementation. However, the relative abundance of MYb11 was approximately 60% in non-supplemented media and increased to approximately 75% with 100 mM L-serine supplementation (GLM, P &lt; 0.002, Fig. 5B, right panel). The observed proportions of MYb11 in worms at 100 mM serine were significantly higher than expected based on proportions in the lawn and thus colonization probability compared to MYb71 (chi-squared test, Χ2 = 10.244, df = 1, P = 0.0013; see Materials and Methods). This suggests that the provision of serine enriches MYb11 in the host independently from the enrichment observed on the lawn and that serine allows MYb11 to overcome its growth disadvantages in competition with MYb71 in the host (see also: Table S18 and S19).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">spectrum.01144-23.f005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>45388</offset><text>L-serine supplementation alters bacterial abundance in C. elegans.

We propose that the most effective way to modulate the composition of the microbiome is by modulating or enriching the abundance of an already existing bacterial species with health-beneficial effects using precision prebiotics. A direct approach to identify such precision prebiotics would be to provide compounds that are uniquely taken up by the bacterial target species. However, through an analysis of C. elegans and human microbiome data, we were able to show that such unique uptake compounds typically only exist for few species in a microbial community and especially for larger communities there are no such compounds at all. Thus, in a typical microbiome, precision prebiotics have to be identified from compounds that are potentially taken up by several species. To identify such compounds, we used genome-scale metabolic networks of two bacterial members from the C. elegans microbiome, O. vermis MYb71, and the host-protective P. lurida MYb11, in conjunction with constraint-based modeling to identify compounds that specifically increased the growth of MYb11. Using HMDB annotation, we found that fatty acids were enriched as predicted growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 which is in agreement with previous observations of the preference of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas for these compounds. Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross-referencing with Biolog data revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, D-mannitol, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol-3-phosphate, L-serine, trehalose, L-threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. We experimentally tested four of these predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and GABA in vitro and confirmed their positive effect specifically on the growth of MYb11. Moving into the C. elegans host system, we were able to show that L-serine is also able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 in vivo, when the host was colonized with both bacterial species. Interestingly, while 10 mM of L-serine was sufficient for an enrichment of MYb11 in batch culture, 100 mM was necessary in the growth experiments with the host. This suggests differences in either bacterial uptake kinetics for L-serine or bacterial growth in general between batch growth and growth on agar plates. Moreover, while MYb11 was strongly enriched in worms to similar levels like MYb71 even though it had a very low abundance in the lawn, this enrichment was even stronger when supplying L-serine. Thus, our proof-of-principle work demonstrates that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49608</offset><text>The effect of serine and threonine on the host and/or on its microbiome has been also documented in the literature.

Longevity effects on the host have been shown also after supplementation with threonine and serine, while dietary serine reduced host fitness through acting on bacterial metabolism, when it was supplemented along with the chemotherapeutic 5-fluoro 2′deoxyuridine. Moreover, serine promotes the growth of E. coli LF82 in the mouse gut, which shows the potential of this compound to alter the abundance of multiple species.

Different approaches to achieve restricted bioavailability, such as the supplementation of non-digestible carbohydrates or coating of supplements with compounds that dissolve during passage through the digestive tract have been developed. Moreover, as indicated by our analysis of concentration-dependent effects of supplementation in the case of serine, it might be necessary to control the specific concentrations of a compound that are being released and their stability over time in the gut. From the bacterial side, Biolog assays have shown that MYb11 has the capacity to catabolize serine (Fig. 2D). However, the specific concentrations used on the Biolog plates and the mechanisms of transport that are possibly dependent on those concentrations are not known. From the host side, to maintain relatively constant concentrations in the host environment or to deviate from its normal concentrations, advanced formulations such as nanotechnology, delayed release, and other drug delivery technologies could be employed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51535</offset><text>Although our combined computational-experimental approach can serve as a blueprint for future studies aimed at the identification of precision prebiotics, several factors should still be taken into consideration. As we showed, it is nearly impossible to identify a compound that is uniquely taken up by only one species within a community. This point becomes apparent, if we consider the numerous different species that reside in various hosts. For instance, the synthetic bacterial community of C. elegans, CeMbio has 12 members, while the human-related bacterial community AGORA has more than 800 species. Thus, an important next step is to scale up our approach to more complex communities. Also along these lines, we did use automatically reconstructed bacterial metabolic networks from our gapseq approach rather than manually curated networks which resembles the typical situation in the human gut microbiota where a detailed manual reconstruction of the hundreds to thousands of already detected and sequenced bacterial species is practically impossible. Furthermore, since the physiology of worms cannot be directly compared to the physiology of humans, the efficacy and effectiveness of the approach [see more on the topic ] need to be studied in more detail. At this point, the complexity of the regulatory affairs in various jurisdictions (e.g., the definition of nutritional supplementation vs medication, safety concerns) should also not be underestimated. Additionally, while the modeling approach we used has quite a number of underlying assumptions, it allowed us to considerably narrow down the list of potential candidate metabolites for experimental testing. Finally, we did not consider potential side effects of the supplemented metabolites on the worm host and did not optimize the mode of delivery, for instance, to release the supplement specifically in the worm gut, which are important considerations for future studies. Taking everything into consideration, we showed that the in silico design of targeted supplementation strategies to modulate the microbiome is not only feasible but also promising for the development of future microbiome-based treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>53720</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>53743</offset><text>DATA AVAILABILITY</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53761</offset><text>The R scripts and the raw data to conduct the simulations are deposited in Github (version/commit: e15eb1e).
