C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1677</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1690</offset><text>Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals. C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections. Because of the severity of these infections, C. albicans pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections, C. albicans lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2134</offset><text>One host setting associated with enrichment for C. albicans in the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption. Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD. C. albicans is enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD. Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD, showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2790</offset><text>The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain. The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction. Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving. Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving. Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively. These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3491</offset><text>As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption in rats. Serum PGE2 levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization by C. albicans. Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids, another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor. The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in C. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2 in reducing ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4234</offset><text>In this study, we show that C. albicans GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption.

The reduction in ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonist treatment.

Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) (Figures 1A, B). C. albicans-colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to water (H2O-only) (Figure 1C). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice throughout the experiment (Figure 1D).

Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice (Figures 2B, C).

Mock-colonized mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or preference (Figure 3A,B). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2.

However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans-colonized mouse were observed. Gene expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A,B demonstrates that mice with higher concentrations of serum PGE2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2. In mock-colonized mice, there were no significant correlations (Figure 4C,D).

Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in expression in the PFC or NAc (Figure S3).

These results indicate that modest increases in serum PGE2 are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE2 in circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher levels of PGE2 in multiple organs.

Additionally, a negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice.

Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption. If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with C. albicans colonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD.

In conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27543</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>27565</offset><text>Animals</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27573</offset><text>Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4–5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling.

Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice. The first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours daily (termed days 1–5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated with C. albicans or PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12.

(D-F) Groups are defined as Mock + SS: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 (open circles); Mock + EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (open triangles); Ca + SS: C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 (black circles); Ca + EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (black triangles). (G) Groups are defined as Ca/Mock + SS + Veh, fed C. albicans (black circles) or sterile PBS (open circles), received sterile saline and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Veh, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Ants, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and antagonist injections; Ca + Et + Veh, fed C. albicans, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Ca + Et + Ants, fed C. albicans, received ethanol and antagonist injections. All injections were IP, given before habituation or testing. Ethanol injections were 1.5g/kg of mouse weight and antagonists were 2g/kg of both EP1 and EP2 antagonists. (B) time after 3.5 g/kg ethanol injection (seconds) for the mouse to lose its righting reflex (LORR onset). (C) blood ethanol concentration (mg/dL) at the time of euthanization following LORR onset. (D) distance traveled in the open field test in a ten minute trial, shown relative to the average of the sterile saline-injected (SS) mice within the same group (mock-colonized or Ca-colonized). (E) total number of foot slips and “falls” during three trials of the balance beam test. A foot slip was defined as the foot slipping beneath the balance beam and a fall was defined as falling to the underside of the beam, or, on rare occasions, a fall off the beam. (F) cumulative time required to cross the balance beam in three trials. (G) total number of slips or “falls” from the EP-antagonist experiments. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with EP1 and EP2 antagonists or vehicle daily on days 0–4 approximately one hour before each behavioral test. (B,C) Ordinary One-Way ANOVAs were completed for statistical significance. (D-G) Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVAs were completed for statistical significance. (B-G) Bars show means with the standard deviation or geometric mean with geometric standard deviation.

C. albicans has been shown to contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Outside of this, the impact of intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, C. albicans, can alter mammalian ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E2. The results highlight novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.</text></passage></document>
