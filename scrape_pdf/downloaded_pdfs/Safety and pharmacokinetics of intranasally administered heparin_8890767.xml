Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging. SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets and sometimes fecal-oral routes, potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues. Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2606</offset><text>SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces. Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors, for example, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs. These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3969</offset><text>Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration. Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series of in vivo pharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5764</offset><text>Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans.

When sex was considered independently, a one-way ANOVA revealed no difference in the extent of weight gain between any of the treatment doses in females (p &gt; 0.05). In males, between group differences were observed and a post-hoc Bonferonni test revealed a statistically significant increase in weight gain in mice treated with 6 μg/day heparin versus vehicle-only control (mean: 1.33 g gain vs 0.33 g gain, p = 0.018). No differences in the weights of mice receiving lower or higher doses were observed (Fig. 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">11095_2022_3191_Fig2_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>22459</offset><text>Dose dependence of frequency of minor observations reported for 14-day heparin trial in mice.

Only one mouse (male, 6 μg/day heparin) showed irritation on more than one day of the study and the three days of observed irritation were non-consecutive and ended on day 10. No signs of epistaxis or topical bleeding were evident in any mice during the study (Fig. 1). Overall, the frequency of observed minor effects for heparin-dosed animals were small and consistent between males and females (0.29 ± 0.07 events per day for males, 0.29 ± 0.10 events per day for females). No dose-dependence was observed in the frequency of minor effects for heparin-dosed animals (Fig. 2). The frequency of observed minor effects in vehicle-only control animals in males (0.22 ± 0.10 events per day) or females (0.49 ± 0.14 events per day) was not significantly different from heparin-dosed animals (p &gt; 0.05), suggesting the minor irritation may be attributed to the technical aspects of inspiration-timed intranasal administration in young mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">11095_2022_3191_Fig3_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24095</offset><text>Blood platelet count after 14 days of daily administration of 60 μg of intranasal heparin in mice.

Unlike residence in the lungs, the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near-IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95 Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000 Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R-heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6A). The resulting CF680R-heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near-IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67 μg of CF680R-heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two-phase model (p = 0.37), with a one-phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig. 6B). The observed half-life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34 min (95% CI 22.7–66.6 min). At the goal of 12 h protection time post-dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3 and an initial dose of 60 μg found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60 mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12 h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC50 measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry. Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig. 6C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30431</offset><text>Tolerability of Intranasal Heparin in Healthy Human Volunteers</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">11095_2022_3191_Fig7_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig7</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>30494</offset><text>Blood results from intranasal heparin human subjects.

The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000 U/day and 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24 h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16 day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre-study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig. 7A and B). Platelet counts were also performed during pre-study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre-study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. 7C). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table I. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow-up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000 U/day for at least 14 days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>34241</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34252</offset><text>Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60 μg/day. From the findings of in vivo imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12 h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000 U/day for at least 14 days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>35587</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>35613</offset><text>Publisher’s Note</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>35632</offset><text>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>35751</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">141</infon><infon key="issue">3</infon><infon key="lpage">154</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Hu;given-names:B</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Guo;given-names:H</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Zhou;given-names:P</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Shi;given-names:ZL</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">33024307</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Nat Rev Microbiol</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">19</infon><infon key="year">2021</infon><offset>35762</offset><text>Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">185</infon><infon key="lpage">193</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Nicola;given-names:M</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Alsafi;given-names:Z</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Sohrabi;given-names:C</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Kerwan;given-names:A</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Al-Jabir;given-names:A</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Iosifidis;given-names:C</infon><infon key="name_6">surname:Agha;given-names:M</infon><infon key="name_7">surname:Agha;given-names:R</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">32305533</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Int J Surg</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">78</infon><infon key="year">2020</infon><offset>35805</offset><text>The socio-economic implications of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19): a review</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><offset>35886</offset><text>Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
