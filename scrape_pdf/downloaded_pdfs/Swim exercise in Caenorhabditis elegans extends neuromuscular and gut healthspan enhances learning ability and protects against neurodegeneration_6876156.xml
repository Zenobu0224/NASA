The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple C. elegans tissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2880</offset><text>Physical inactivity is a worldwide public health problem. Globally, more than 5 million premature deaths each year (∼9%) may be attributable to insufficient physical activity. Conversely, it is striking that exercise provides widespread health benefits, including protection against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and against age-associated declines in muscle, immune, and cognitive function. Given the overwhelming projected social and economic costs of caring for the growing inactive and elderly populations, defining how activity and exercise physiology promote healthier aging is of critical importance. Unfortunately, however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate systemic exercise benefits remain poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is partially due to the lack of established short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions on transtissue exercise signaling can be evaluated over the entire aging process. Importantly, exercise training in Drosophila improves motility, cardiac performance, and mitochondrial health, supporting that exercise adaptation is conserved from invertebrates to humans, and opening the door to the exploitation of powerful invertebrate model systems for mechanistic dissection of health benefit circuits in exercise biology.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4208</offset><text>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model widely used in aging and stress research that holds great potential to unlock the molecular circuitry involved in exercise-dependent systemic health benefits.

C. elegans reach adulthood in ∼2.5 d and self-reproduce for approximately the first 6 d of adult life. The reduction in reproductive capacity is accompanied by age-related decline in multiple tissues and functions over the next several days, including locomotion, muscle structure, pharyngeal pumping, intestinal integrity, and neuronally controlled actions. The aging C. elegans body wall muscle exhibits nuclear fragmentation, mitochondrial network and sarcomere disorganization, lipid accumulation, and loss of muscle mass, resembling the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle strength and muscle mass that contributes to human frailty).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5257</offset><text>We have shown previously that swimming in a liquid environment is more energetically demanding for C. elegans than the crawling motion on agar plates used in standard laboratory growth protocols.

Hartman et al. found that a 6-d swim exercise regimen in C. elegans improves body wall muscle mitochondrial morphology, changes mitochondrial respiration parameters, and protects against acute exposure to the mito-toxicants rotenone and arsenic. Other exercise paradigms in C. elegans have been described, with a focus on body wall muscle- and mitochondrial-related phenotypes.

We planned to determine an efficacious long-term exercise regimen in C. elegans by characterizing the impact of different numbers of 90-min swim sessions in M9 buffer executed over the first 4 d of adult life (Fig. 1A), a period that corresponds to the peak locomotory performance phase and constitutes a timeframe over which C. elegans are able to complete 90-min swims without any significant inactive periods. We tested long-term exercise regimens with swim frequencies of 1 session per day (1+1+1+1), 2 sessions per day (2+2+2+2), 3 sessions per day on the first 2 d of adulthood plus 2 sessions per day on the third and fourth adult days (3+3+2+2), 3 sessions per day (3+3+3+3), and 4 sessions per day (4+4+4+4) (Fig. 1B). The exercise adaptation readouts we quantitated included both a molecular assay (gene-expression analysis by qPCR) and a functional assay (locomotion analysis by recording movement and calculating crawling maximum velocity). Importantly, given that our interest is in defining regimens that lead to medium- to long-term physiological changes (i.e., exercise adaptation and system-wide health benefits), we assayed molecular and functional readouts 1 to several days postexercise, rather than immediately after the last swim session.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pnas.1909210116fig01.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig01</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8955</offset><text>Multiple daily swim sessions are essential for C. elegans exercise adaptation.

In mammals, long-term endurance exercise leads to profound transcriptional changes at the muscle level, with up-regulation of muscle structural genes, such as troponins, tropomyosins, myosin light chains, and myosin heavy chains, as one of the reproducible changes. Therefore, we first wanted to determine if long-term swim exercise regimens could also promote the up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression in C. elegans. We selected 10 C. elegans genes that included the major structural gene classes found to be up-regulated in mammals in an exercise-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Table S1). Importantly, all of the genes we included in our analysis have been documented to be massively down-regulated with age in C. elegans, which underscores their potential importance in age-associated sarcopenia and locomotory decline.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10769</offset><text>We performed qPCR for the test swim regimens 1 d after the training was completed, which corresponds to adult day 5 (Ad5) (Fig. 1C). We found that the 1+1+1+1 regimen led to an overall tendency of down-regulation across the muscle structural gene test set, supporting that single daily swim sessions are insufficient to induce exercise adaptations (at least at the molecular level). In contrast, 2+2+2+2, 3+3+2+2, and 3+3+3+3 regimens led to an overall up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression. The 3+3+2+2 regimen induced the most consistent transcriptional up-regulation profile with 6 of the 10 test genes (tnt-2, unc-27, mlc-1, unc-54, zig-12, and unc-87) exhibiting a statistically significant difference when compared to the control animals. We noted up-regulation of 4 of the 10 genes after just 2 d of training (3+3 regimen) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A); muscle structural gene expression of 3+3+2+2 exercised animals returned to approximately control levels by Ad8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The 4+4+4+4 regimen induced a wider range of transcriptional outcomes (2 genes showing a significant up-regulation [tnt-2 and unc-27] and 2 genes showing a significant down-regulation [unc-15 and myo-3]) and reflected a trend toward down-regulation that suggested excessive exercise can be deleterious to maintained muscle expression (Fig. 1C). Overall, our data establish that a training plan of 3+3+2+2 can induce increased transcription of a battery of C. elegans muscle structural genes, paralleling a feature of mammalian exercise adaptation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12321</offset><text>To assess training impact on muscle performance, we also measured a functional readout of our long-term C. elegans exercise regimens. We focused on the C. elegans crawling maximum velocity since this parameter has been documented to accurately report movement ability, correlates well with healthspan, and can even be a longevity predictor at certain ages. We measured maximum velocity by placing Ad5 and Ad8 single animals on agar plates and determining the maximum speed at which they move over a 30-s time interval. Note that our swim-exercised animals were not specifically trained for enhancement of crawling maximum velocity, so maximum velocity serves as an indicator of overall vigor that results from swim training. The 1+1+1+1 regimen failed to significantly increase maximum velocity of exercised animals compared to controls on both days (Fig. 1D), independently supporting our conclusion from transcriptional studies that single daily swim sessions are not sufficient to induce long-term exercise adaptations. In contrast, we found that all of the multiple daily swim regimens promoted a significant increase in maximum velocity, on the order of a 10 to 20% increase over nonexercised animals assayed at Ad5 (Fig. 1D). We found a trend toward increased maximum velocity on Ad8 (4 d after cessation of training) for all 4 multiple daily swim regimens, but only the 3+3+2+2 regimen led to a statistically significant 24% increase (Fig. 1D; see SI Appendix, Fig. S1C for all maximum velocity values).

Nevertheless, it remained possible that continuous reexposure of C. elegans to the M9 buffer liquid environment during the long-term exercise regimens might induce some physiological benefits. To definitively rule out simple liquid exposure as an important factor for the molecular and functional changes we documented above, we constructed microfluidic devices in which C. elegans can be exposed to M9 buffer but for which we could manipulate the locomotion type (crawling vs. swimming) by modulating the chamber height. To test whether exposure to the M9 buffer swim media might suffice to induce exercise adaptations, we performed the 3+3+2+2 regimen by transferring C. elegans from seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plates to M9 buffer-filled microfluidic devices that had a large chamber height (swim exercise possible) (Movie S1) or a small chamber height (control, animals are sedate and crawl rather than swim) (Movie S2) for 90 min. After each 90-min session, we recovered animals from the microfluidic chambers and returned them to seeded NGM plates. We conducted qPCR analysis at Ad5 to find that microfluidics-exercised C. elegans up-regulate muscle structural genes (statistically significant for tnt-2, mlc-1, unc-54, and zig-12) as compared to microfluidics-constrained control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), similar to the outcomes of the 3+3+2+2 regimen performed on NGM plates (Fig. 1C). We also determined that muscle structural gene expression was not up-regulated in microfluidics-control animals relative to plate-control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), confirming that liquid exposure is not sufficient for muscle transcriptional induction. Importantly, we found that the microfluidics-exercised animals exhibited a significant increase in maximum velocity on Ad8 relative to microfluidics nonexercised animals, similar to the 3+3+2+2 regimen implemented by flooding plates with M9 buffer (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). Our data establish that transcriptional and functional changes induced in M9 buffer require swim activity rather than being the consequence of liquid exposure, and independently confirm that long-term swim regimens induce exercise adaptations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16736</offset><text>Long-Term Swim Exercise Improves Performance and Healthspan of C. elegans Body Wall Muscle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16828</offset><text>The C. elegans body wall muscle is the tissue most directly involved in long-term exercise training and thus we sought to characterize additional aspects of body wall muscle performance and health consequent to exercise.

We loaded liquid-phase Pluronic F-127 on top of C. elegans in 12-well plates, and allowed the Pluronic F-127 to quickly gel at room temperature, trapping animals under the gel. We then added Escherichia coli OP50-1 on top of the gel, which serves as a food attractant (assay diagram in Fig. 2A). In this 3D gel environment, animals with a better neuromuscular performance reach the surface faster and in higher numbers. After a 3+3+2+2 training regimen, Ad5 exercised nematodes reached the gel surface at a significantly higher proportion during the 3-h burrowing assay window as compared to their nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 2B). Exercised animals have similar chemotactic ability toward E. coli OP50-1 relative to control animals in standard 2D chemotaxis assays on agar plates, supporting similar attraction to OP50-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

C. elegans, just like mammals, exhibit a well-described age-related decline in muscle mitochondrial morphology, characterized by increased disorganization and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. We performed confocal imaging of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals at different life stages to establish our own classification system for muscle mitochondrial network health that reflects a progressive increase in fragmentation and disorganization from class 1 (complete mitochondrial coverage of body wall muscle cells and tubular mitochondrial morphology) to class 5 (greatly reduced number of mitochondria and round morphology) (Fig. 2C). After the 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen, we took confocal images of the anterior body wall muscle of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals on Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, and scored the images blind to exercise condition using the freely available software Blinder. We found that exercised animals exhibited a significant improvement in muscle mitochondrial network organization at all 3 time points tested (Fig. 2D), even though Ad11 corresponds to a full 7 d after the last exercise session.

In the Seahorse assays for measuring oxygen consumption rates, basal respiration is first monitored; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) is then added to inhibit ATP synthase, which reveals relative ATP-linked respiration and distinguishes the residual proton leak; carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) then uncouples mitochondria, collapsing the proton gradient, such that the electron transport chain (ETC) is uninhibited and oxygen consumption by complex IV reaches the maximal rate (the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration is the spare capacity); addition of sodium azide (a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor) shuts down all mitochondrial respiration to reveal nonmitochondrial respiration (Fig. 3A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pnas.1909210116fig03.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig03</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>22672</offset><text>Long-term exercise improves mitochondrial respiration parameters and midlife survival.

A mild mitochondrial uncoupling by a higher proton leak has been suggested to protect against excessive reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in active tissues and organisms. Therefore, the increase in proton leak of exercised animals on Ad5 (Fig. 3F) might be a protective mechanism against excessive oxidative stress during and shortly after the long-term exercise regimen, with the proton leak returning to control levels by Ad8. We observed a decrease in nonmitochondrial respiration of exercised animals on Ad8 relative to nonexercised animals (Fig. 3G).

The C. elegans intestine constitutes a strong barrier to gut content leak in young animals, but with age, intestinal barrier function breaks down. Breakdown of intestinal barrier function can be measured by feeding a nonabsorbable blue dye and checking for dye leakage outside the intestine, an assay referred to as the “Smurf assay” since animals turn blue like cartoon Smurfs. We assayed the maintenance of gut integrity in exercised vs. nonexercised controls using the Smurf assay to confirm that animals with intestinal epithelial integrity retained the blue dye within the intestinal tract, whereas animals with a compromised intestinal barrier leak the blue dye to their body cavity (Fig. 4 B–D). We found that the percentage of Smurf animals in both control and exercise samples was very low at Ad8 after a 3+3+2+2 regimen (Fig. 4E), consistent with prior studies that revealed the later life onset of this aspect of gut decline. Later in life (Ad11), we found that the proportion of Smurf animals was one-third lower in exercise versus control (Fig. 4E). Differences disappeared at Ad15 (Fig. 4E).

Similar to observations in humans, the effect of exercise on C. elegans longevity seems to be highly dependent on the adopted exercise regimen with reported outcomes in previous studies varying from detrimental to beneficial. Our 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen promoted a consistent increase in midlife population survival rather than an increase in maximum lifespan. Thus, exercised populations are able to survive extra days during the time-window when the mortality rate is at its peak. It is important to note that in our studies, this time-window occurs 8 to 16 d after the last exercise session, raising the possibility that extension of the swim regimen beyond the first 4 d of adulthood may further potentiate survival differences and underscoring that early adult activity can have long lasting impact on healthy aging.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>47405</offset><text>Nonexercising cardiac-like muscle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47440</offset><text>One of the pressing questions in exercise biology is how physical activity can promote health benefits in multiple tissues of the body, especially in those tissues not directly engaged by neuromuscular activity.
